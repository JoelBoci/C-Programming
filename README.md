# C-Programming

This is an Enigma Machine that I have written in C for my Cyber Security assignment
<br>
I have tried to implement the machine fully but I may be missing some things
<br>
The machine has been developed with the following high-level functionality:
<ul>
    <li>Capable of <strong>encrypting</strong> and <strong>decrypting</strong> messages constructed of alphabet characters (a-z) to a minimum length of <strong>676 characters</strong></li>
    <li>The user can <strong>configure</strong> the Enigma machine by selecting the rotors, rotor positions and the plug board settings</li>
</ul>
<br>
I have also implemented a nice UI that is best viewed fullscreen which makes it easier to use the program. There are notes in the program that will guide you through it and how to set everything up correctly.
<br>
I hope you enjoy the program; if you come across any bugs or if you have any recommended changes then please feel free to let me know.
